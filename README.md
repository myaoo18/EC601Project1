# EC601Project1 Visual Question Answering
## Summary
Visual question ansewring (VQA) is a computer vision application where a system is given an open-ended question about an image, and the system must respond to its most accurate understanding of its vision, language and commonsense knowledge. 

## Problem Statement
With emerging technologies for image recognition, language processing and computers perfoming tasks at a complex level, human lives can be better with a system that could properly answer questions when asked. For example, VQA is useful in aiding a visually-impaired user to navigate a world that is built for the sighted, educating non-native speaker and children on books or games with touch screen and advancing the development of artificial intelligence. 

According to the World Health Organization, a study has found that at least 2.2 billion people globally have a near of distance vision impariment (1). It is estimated to be four times higher to find people with vision impariment in low and middle-income regions than high-income regions. WHO points out that "young children with early onset severe vision impariment can experience delayed motor, language, emotional, social and cognitive development, with lifelong consequences". The technology of VQA would not only help individuals with blindess -visual acuity worse than 3/60, but it would also help the many population of people including children to continue development and the understanding of visuals. 

In order to completely solve artificial intelligence, a practical application that is capable of answering general and diverse questions about visual environment is paramount. A powerful artifical intelligence can recgnoize objects in a scene, understand the relationships and express its knowledge in natural langauge - typically in a few words or a short sentence. While this task is seemingly trivial for human beings, it requires a computer to comprehend the question and parse through the visual elements in an image (2). VQA is the solution to this purpose where it uses an algorithm or a trained model to extra high-level infromation from images and perform reasoning based on that information (2).
